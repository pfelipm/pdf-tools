**PDF_Tools** is a lightweight and powerful extension for Google Chrome that integrates PDF file manipulation tools directly into your browser through a modern side panel. Merge and split PDF documents with ease, without the need to install heavy software or rely on online services.

This extension was born from the need to have quick and efficient tools at hand for the most common tasks with PDF files. Instead of opening desktop applications or uploading sensitive files to the web, PDF_Tools processes everything locally in your browser, ensuring speed and privacy.
